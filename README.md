# Covid_19
- Project Overview
-        Project CoronaGo aims to achieve a targeted controlled mitigation of the rate of spread of COVID-19 infection by implementing diverse approaches such as
              1. Design and deployment of a dedicated website, called "The Covidinator" for:
              a. Easy online triaging of patients based on medical history and risk factors. 
              b. Increasing awareness in local communities by using interesting tools such as multilingual interactive quizzes on important topics such as sanitation, general protection, and apprehension of Covid symptoms. Thus, creating a community that well informed and safer. 
              c. Providing verified and reliable sources of information about Covid-19. <br />
              2. Ideating and deploying a tested streamlined workflow design for swift production of superior quality cloth-masks and other protective equipment using readily available materials and simple assembly training. Also, providing a very simple sterilization method of used masks at home using simple autoclave construction using pressure cooker. <br />
              
              3. Deployment of advanced strategies in hospital environments and other high-risk enclosures using guided airflow to create stronger containment units. Planned use sanitation gates and of Positive and Negative pressure zones in the hospital for controlling droplet spread and thus greatly reducing the risk of contact of the virus with the hospital staff.
